      <p id="intro"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_internment_camps">The Xinjiang Internment Camps</a>, 
        officially called "Vocational Education and Training Centers" by the government of China, 
        are internment camps operated by the government of Xinjiang and the Chinese Communist Party.
        Human Rights Watch says that they have been used to indoctrinate Uyghurs and other Muslims since 2017 
        as part of a "people's war on terror", a policy announced in 2014.</br></br>
        The camps were established in 2017 by the administration of CCP general secretary Xi Jinping.
        <a href=https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-mass-detentions-china-razes-muslim-communities-to-build-a-loyal-city-11553079629">In Internment Camps, over a million Uyghurs and other minnorities are in there, suffering torture, brainwashing, and forced labour.</a>
        The purpose of Internment Camps is trying to erase the culture of Uyghurs and other minnorities by destroying their mosques, culture, and language.</br></br>
